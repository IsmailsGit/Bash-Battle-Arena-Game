Level 1 completed -  The mission of this level was to create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. 
List the contents of the Arena directory.

I used the mkdir command to make the directory 'Arena'. I then went into that directory using the command cd Arena.
Then I used the touch command to make the files warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt.
Then ls Arena to list the contents of the arena directory.
